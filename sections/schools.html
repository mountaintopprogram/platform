                <p>The Mountaintop Program brings humanity's foremost thinkers, doers, and leaders to your school with the sole purpose of inspiring and energizing your students. We carefully vet our Guides and work closely with teachers and school administrators to design a customized program that will fit each and every school's needs, ranging from occasional talks to full-on project-oriented collaboration throughout the semester.</p>
                <p>We are currently piloting the Mountaintop Program free for schools in the greater NYC area, with plans to expand further following the pilot. All we ask of you is your feedback as we continue to fine tune the program. Slots are currently open for the Fall 2015 and Spring 2016 semesters.</p>
