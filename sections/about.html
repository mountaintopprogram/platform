                <h1>The Climb</h1>
                <p>Mountaintop is a new educational initiative that dares students to find and follow their passions. We source outstanding innovators whose creativity and persistence have improved all of our lives, who we call Mountaintop Guides, then bring them to NYC-area high schools for candid talks about their climb, success, and the pitfalls they encountered along the way. Students come away inspired and energized, and knowing that they too have the potential to change the world.</p>
                <p>Participating schools also have the option to pursue a more intensive workshop program, where Guides act as mentors as students pursue their own projects, creating the future of humanity without ever leaving the classroom.</p>
                <p>Interested in <a href="/schools">hosting Mountaintop at your school?</a></p>

As an associate consultant at <a href="http://www.accelerationgroup.net" target="_blank">Acceleration Group</a>, she uses her combination of analytical and design skills to help innovative ventures and nonprofits transform their operations and launch new solutions that expand their access to opportunity.  In her undergraduate studies, despite completing three majors in Manufacturing Management, Production Management, and Entrepreneurship, she was left discovering how her education fit into her ambitions. During her last year in college, she picked up web development in order to create a platform that helps reduce the financial burden of college by promoting the recycling of used textbooks from student communities to the subsequent class. This project became a springboard for her mission and she has developed a deep commitment to enabling young people to discover their entrepreneurial potential and gain the skills to use it.</p>
