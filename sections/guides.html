                <h1>Become a Mountaintop Guide</h1>
                <p>Mountaintop Guides are role models for humanity - leaders in their communities, scholars, artists, musicians, engineers, entrepreneurs, and worldchangers. We invite Guides to NYC-area high schools to speak openly about both the rewards and trials of their experience, inspiring students to pursue their dreams while building an understanding of what those dreams will take. Our program is flexible and we're able to accommodate arrangements from a single talk to an entire semester collaborating with students. Join us and help inspire the next generation of leaders.</p>

                            <p>Tiffany Kwan is on a mission to foster creativity and passion in others. As an associate consultant at <a href="http://www.accelerationgroup.net" target="_blank">Acceleration Group</a>, she uses her combination of analytical and design skills to help innovative ventures and nonprofits transform their operations and launch new solutions that expand their access to opportunity.  In her undergraduate studies, despite completing three majors in Manufacturing Management, Production Management, and Entrepreneurship, she was left discovering how her education fit into her ambitions. During her last year in college, she picked up web development in order to create a platform that helps reduce the financial burden of college by promoting the recycling of used textbooks from student communities to the subsequent class. This project became a springboard for her mission and she has developed a deep commitment to enabling young people to discover their entrepreneurial potential and gain the skills to use it.</p>
