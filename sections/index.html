                <h1>Everyone is an innovator</h1>
                <p>The Mountaintop Program was born in 2015 at Columbia University, after the founders met at a tech entrepreneurship panel and realized that they shared a common vision of what education could become: not merely a way to instill rote knowledge, but a place where students could <em>create</em> their own futures, doubling down on their dreams and advancing society with the guidance of the best people possible - those who have already made the climb.</p>
                <p>We offer in and after-school programs to NYC-area high schools and community organizations, bringing accomplished Mountaintop Guides into class for one hour per week to speak candidly about their endeavors, trials, and setbacks and address the uncertainties and fears which can prevent students from pursuing their dreams. We then flip mentorship on its head, challenging students to develop novel solutions of their own with the help of Guides and transforming your school into <em>the accelerator for everyone</em>. The program culminates in a demo day, where students present their projects to Guides, angel investors, and employers, creating change in their communities and securing their prospects for the future.</p>
