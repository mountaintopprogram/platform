    	<h1>Particle Accelerator</h1>
        <div class="ImageCarousel"><img src="images/accelerator.jpg" alt="Particle Accelerator" /></div>

    	<p>Just a group of kids looking to develop a particle
accelerator for miscellaneous uses, mostly for purposes of
physics research to promote scientific innovation in our
high school and surrounding areas. Some other side
projects our team is working on will include fighting
cancer, killing bacteria on food borne illnesses, and
creating a team of crime fighting time travelers.</p>
		<p>Project update: We received underground clearance
parallel to the Q train. Looks like Brooklyn will have two
particle accelerators soon: that mini low energy one and
our massive seven mile one!</p>
